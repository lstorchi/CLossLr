# Custom LOSS function LR 


This i a a module implementing Linear Models with Custom Loss Functions.

- In the module there are some possible Loss function 
- The test code in the JNB shows that using the residual_sum_square one can 
  obtain the same coefficients as the standard LR scikit-learn model
